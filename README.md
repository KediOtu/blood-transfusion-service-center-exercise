# :sparkles: blood-transfusion-service-center-exercise :sparkles:





### :boom: I try to learn machine learning by practicing. I use the dataset 'blood-transfusion-service-center' from OpenML




### :boom: In the file, my codes will appear part by part. Because I want to make clear my learning process for myself. I took lots of notes while coding. :shipit:

---------------------------------------------------------------------
**Logistic_Reg_1:** I got the dataset and tried to figure out what is it and understand how can I use it. I made a logistic regression model. Then I observed its score and predictions.

**Logistic_Reg_2:** I looked for if there are any missing elements in the dataset and then handled them.

**Logistic_Reg_3:** I found out the column 'V3' need to be dropped because of correlated features. I mean, I need to drop correlated features while preprocessing the data.

**Logistic_Reg_4:** I got square root all of the data. Then I did the other preprocessing operations. I just try to get higher score on this dataset with Logistic Regression. While doing this, I learn data preprocessing. The score changes every time I run the code. Sometimes the score after processing the data is higher and sometimes it is not. I think its reason is splitting the train set and test set randomly. It looks like I need to find the best split.

**Logistic_Reg_5:** While splitting the data I chose a random state number. So the data will split in the same way every time. Also I found a more easy way to handle the missing values.
