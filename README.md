### :boom: I try to learn Logistic Regression by practicing. I use the dataset 'blood-transfusion-service-center' from OpenML




### :boom: In the file, my codes will appear part by part. Because I want to make clear my learning process for myself. I took lots of notes while coding. :shipit:

---------------------------------------------------------------------
**PART1:** I got the dataset and tried to figure out what is it and understand how can I use it.

**PART2:** I looked for if there are any missing elements and then handled them.

**PART3:** I found out the column 'V3' need to be dropped because of correlated features. I mean, I need to drop correlated features while preprocessing the data.

**PART4:** I got square root all of the data. Then I did the other preprocessing operations. I just try to get higher score on this dataset with Logistic Regression. While doing this, I learn data preprocessing. When I run the code the score change too much. Sometimes the score after processing the data is higher and sometimes it is not. I think its reason is splitting the train set and test set randomly. It looks like I need to find  best split.
